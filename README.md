# credit-risk-classification

This Challenge uses various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. A dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company is used to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. 
The following steps were carried out to produce the analysis:

* The data was split in to training and testing sets
* A logistic regression model was created using the original data
* A logistic regression model was created using resampled training data

## Results

* Machine Learning Model 1 (logistic regression model with originatl data):

Loan status | Precision | Recall | F1-Score
| :--- | ---: | :---:
0  | 1.00 | 0.99 | 1.00
1  | 0.85 | 0.91 | 0.88
